We are currently looking for a 5th roommate to share our 5 bedroom house starting Oct 10 up until Nov 1st thru March 1st, with a possible option to renew the lease once the lease ends on March 1st. We have a Large room available, with a big closet and your own bathroom located inside the bedroom.  The house is two stories (your room would be upstairs, along with living room, kitchen, and 2 other bedrooms), has hardwood floors throughout, has a washer and dryer, dishwasher, backyard w/BBQ, granite counter tops and fireplace. Our house is located on San Bruno ave, down the street from the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater and McLaren Park and is very close to the 101 freeway. There are four bus lines running right near the house that will take you downtown - or anywhere else in the city - and there is easy street parking if you have a car. Currently, all of the roommates are between the ages of 23-32  and are working professionals. The house is quiet during the weekdays AND weekends and we would rather not have anyone who parties because we like the house to be clean and quiet. We ask that you be a respectful, drama-free and reasonably mature person with a life (outside the house). No pets are allowed. Please contact me, preferably on the phone number provided, if you would be interested in viewing the place.  You must provide one month security deposit along with 1st months rent at the time of move-in, as well as be approved by the landlord so have a recent credit report as well as employment verification.","0BR apartment  date=""2014-10-10"" today_msg=""available now"">available oct 10<br/>w/d in unit street parking</p>",94134

Built on a grand scale and designed on two levels, this elegant house-like residence is perched high above vibrant Castro Street near 22nd Street atop the ridge separating the Castro from Noe Valley, simultaneously overlooking both Noe and Eureka Valleys, and the downtown SF skyline, as well as looking out over the top of beautiful Liberty Hill.Additional remodeling to the exterior and interior of the building was just completed in May 2014, for a modern, updated and sophisticated look!Pets OK and Welcome!Massive Room Dimensions are approximately as follows:Living/Dining Room - 35' x 14' (enlarging to 20' wide in main living room area)Family Room - 24' x 19'Master Bedroom - 20' x 16'Master Bathroom - 18' x 9' or so at widest point2nd Bedroom - 18.5' x 11.5'3rd Bedroom - 16.5' x 11.5'This large grand home is ideal both for entertaining guests, or simply enjoying the privacy afforded by the separate living areas on opposite ends of the home. Opportunities abound to reallocate some of the space as a 5th bedroom or private sleep area for guests.All bedrooms are about 50% larger than typical.  Even the smallest bedroom is the size of a typical master. The open, flowing floor plan is ideal for hosting or simply retreating to the family room to enjoy the sweet garden outlook. Some of the many specialized features of this home include a gourmet kitchen, nine and a half foot ceilings, custom bookshelves, and both gas and wood-burning fireplaces. The Master Bedroom has sweeping views, as well as a generous double closet and Master Bath. The striking hallway with illuminated, built-in glass shelves leads to the two large rear bedrooms, each of them stepping out to a charming rear patio. The property is semi-detached offering abundant natural light throughout, especially in the living room with its new gas fireplace. The front of the living room extends out far beyond neighboring homes, allowing panoramic views from both the front and sides of the living room that take in downtown SF and Eureka Valley on the left, Liberty Hill and beautiful Victorians across the street, and Noe Valley and the Bay to the right. The formal dining room and living room in the front of the home are grand in scale and design and connect seamlessly, making this home perfect for entertaining.  Gorgeous deep brown walnut hardwood floors were recently installed in the living room, dining room, family room, master bedroom, and hallway, instilling a sense of grandeur and elegance throughout. The gourmet kitchen was remodeled in 2009 and features gorgeous granite countertops, maple cabinets, hi-end Thermador refrigerator and appliances, and an attractive new tiled floor, and opens to the rear family room. The large family room in back of the home, with a 60-inch Pioneer big screen TV and balcony, overlooks a serene flowering garden and is ideal for contemporary urban living. An attractive wine bar was added in 2010. The separation between the living room in front and the family room in back provides for simultaneous entertainment and living opportunities - entertain guests in one room, while other family members relax in another, with virtually complete privacy. The family room is up to twice the size of a typical family room and has ample room for guests to stay overnight or for more extended periods of time. The master bedroom has sweeping views of Downtown, Eureka Valley, and the neighboring Victorian Ladies. There is also generous closet space and a tiled master bath with separate tub and stall shower.  Another big screen TV is included here. The two rear bedrooms are nicely separated from the Master by a long, elegant hallway, with built-in illuminated glass shelves.  Both rear bedrooms have large closets and walkout access to the rear patio.  This home has a top of the line LG washer and dryer.  The home comes optionally semi-furnished with sofa sectionals in the living and family rooms, a lovely dining room table with chairs, and two beds, as well as various cabinets, carpets, and lamps and tables.  You may keep as much or as little as you wish. This house-like residence is perched high above the FLAT block of vibrant Castro Street on top of the ridge which makes walking into and out of the building and its vicinity very easy -- no steep streets to deal with!  You can even stroll around Castro, 22nd, Noe, and Hill streets and it's nearly all flat which makes for a great walk!  It is also a 7-minute walk down to 18th St, and a 5-minute walk down to 24th St.Enjoy the convenient access of Muni (bus stop on end of same block, just 1 door down!) and also an elevator that brings you from street level to near the front door, so you can enjoy those amazing views without having to walk up the hill from 18th or 24th streets, or walk up numerous flights of stairs.New aluminum garage doors were installed in 2013 and look great!  Dedicated garage space optional for $300/mo.Building is Built on rock, making it much safer during an earthquake.In addition to all of this, convenient street parking is available in the very same block around 90% - 95% of the time during the day and early evening, one of the rare desirable neighborhoods in the City where this is the case.  Usually several spaces are available within 75 feet of the front door.  You and your guests will seldom spend more than a few seconds looking for parking!Available September 1st.Virtual tour available at:http://tours.ewalk.com/public/vtour/display/247081?idx=1Call show contact infofor further information.","3BR / 2.5Ba 2800ft2 furnished condo  date=""2014-09-01"" today_msg=""available now"">available sep 01<br/>w/d in unit attached garage<br/>no smoking<br/>cats are OK - purrr dogs are OK - wooof</p>",94114

This place is a dog owner's dream since we have a yard with doggy door, and the park is ½ block away (lots of it is off leash!). Your dog will have to get approved by a 5-year-old golden retriever, an 8-year-old shitzu, and a 15-year-old terrier mix.Easy parking, safe neighborhood, 1 block to the L Line, lots of close restaurants.There are two living rooms, a backyard, a dining room, two full bathrooms and 4 bedrooms, so you will be sharing the downstairs bathroom with 1 other person. The kitchen is amazing. We have very high speed internet. A housekeeper comes every other week to clean the bathrooms and common areas. In total, bills average ~$100/mo each. Our house is very chill, so occasional dinner parties are great but it definitely won't work out if you party a lot or use hard drugs. We are looking for someone who communicates well, contributes fairly to the house, and is financially stable. Please reply with a description of yourself, tell us about your dog (if you have one), and please include your phone number. Have a great day and thanks for taking the time to read our ad!","0BR  date=""2015-06-20"" today_msg=""available now"">available jun 20</p>",94116

The apartment is all about efficiency and would be ideal for someone working in the city who needs a place to call home base, or a crash-pad for a local company's visiting employees. I have used it as both in the past year and everyone who has stayed here has loved it, both for convenience and comfort.The apartment has a kitchenette with a dishwasher, stovetop, and fridge. There is also a queen-sized Murphy Bed that folds up to reveal a table (not shown in the pictures). Because you would be taking over my lease, you get to pay the rent I have been paying instead of the new asking price, which is about $200 more expensive than what I am paying now. The apartment is also wired for WebPass, which is incredibly easy to set up, and Gas, Trash, Water, Sewer are all separate, but less than $100 a month altogether.Though I don't have one reserved, it is possible to get a parking spot in the attached garage, or to reserve additional storage space in the building for pretty cheap. There is also a rooftop deck, laundry on every floor, and Laundry Locker in the garage. The building is very conveniently located, with Caltrain about 2 blocks away, Safeway 1 block away, and quick access to Hwy 80, 101 and 280Ideally, you would take over the lease on the first of February, but I am open to negotiating an earlier move-in date, because my highest priority is getting it off my hands ASAP.
